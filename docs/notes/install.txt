Notes on installation of Vivado.

-----------------
Ubuntu 18.04 LTS
-----------------

1) Installed lastest version of Ubuntu 18.04 LTS

This is technically not supported, and Vivado will complain, but it does work with a minor work-around for petalinx installation, detailed below.

2) Download and install the webpack for the whole vitas suite:

Set /tools/ to a user owned directory, so installed there as normal user.

After installation, used "perl ldd-recursive.pl ..." as described at:
   https://www.xilinx.com/support/answers/66184.html
   to determine the missing libraries:

libtcmalloc.so.4 => not found
libboost_signals.so => not found
librdi_common.so => not found
librdi_commonmain.so => not found

Satisfied the first two with:

$ sudo apt-get install google-perftools
$ sudo apt-get install llibboost-signals-dev

The last two are Xilinx libraries, and are already located in Xilinx
installation lib directory.  To see this, you can set LD_LIBRARY_LOAD
to include the Xilinx libraries, but this isn't really needed.
Evidently, Vivado already finds these libraries.


3) Because I installed as root, the cable drivers were not installed
automatically, so I had to do the following:

- unplug all cables (including SoMs with FTDI driver over USB, effectively a JTAG cable)

$cd /tools/Xilinx/Vivado/2018.3/data/xicom/cable_drivers/lin64/install_script/install_drivers/

$sudo ./install_drivers

4) So that I could have access to the USB TTY device as normal user
from the commandline, I added myself to the dialup group with:

$sudo usermod -a -G dialout <username>

where <username> is replaced with your actual username.  This change
does not take effect until the next time you login to the host.


5) A workaround is needed to sucessefully install petalinux.  There is
an incompatibility between petalinux installer and latest version of
bash used by Ubuntu 18.04 LTS.  To work around this, we temporarily
replace sed with a modified version during petalinux installation.  So
do something like:

$ mkdir ~/workaround 
$ cd ~/workaround
$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mulhearn/pacman/master/docs/workaround/sed
$ chmod ugo+x sed
$ export PATH=~/workaround:$PATH
$ which sed

That last line should show that sed now points to the modified version
in ~/workaround.  This is only needed during the installation!

Now installation of petalinux 2018.3 proceeds as described in the
petalinux tools documentation:

   https://www.xilinx.com/support/documentation/sw_manuals/xilinx2018_3/ug1144-petalinux-tools-reference-guide.pdf

Except note that not all the required tools are installed by the
"Quick installation of packages" commands, notably "gawk" is not
included but possibly others.  I used the quick install command, then
went package by package from the table to make sure every tool is
installed.

Double check with "which sed" to make certain the workaround described
above is still in effect, then run the installer as described in the
documentation.

I installed to /tools/Xilinx/petalinux/2018.3 as a normal user.

You can delete ~/workaround once the installation is complete.

-----------------
Ubuntu 16.04 LTS
-----------------

1) Installed lastest version of Ubuntu 16.04 LTS

This is technically not supported, and Vivado will complain, but it
seems unreasonable to insist on an out-of-date version from 16.04
branch.

2) Download and install the webpack for the whole vitas suite:

Set /tools/ to a user owned directory, so installed there as normal user.

After installation, used "perl ldd-recursive.pl ..." as described at:
