To create the txfifo.tcl file, I did:

start a new project.
open the IP catalog.
double click the IP.
Customize the IP.
Generate the IP.

Then:

get_ips

write_ip_tcl -no_ip_version -ip_name txfifo [get_ips <name chosen from above>] txfifo.tcl

delete the preamble to the file which checks vivado version and creates a project

source in the project creation tcl script.

Load the project, and issue the following tcl, to generate vhdl (as guide for instantiating the IP in RTL):

create_ip_run [get_ips txfifo]
launch_run txfifo_synth_1
