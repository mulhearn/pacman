Requested revisions v1-r1:

- Please add version and revision number to the silkscreen.
(e.g. PACMAN v1-rev2) This will avoid confusion when we start
distributing these to colleagues.


- Make the 12-pin JTAG/UART header consistent with TRENZ.

- Use a slide-in SD card slot

- Some pads are uncomfortably close to TDK-Lambdas.

- Please connect Tile 1 SCL/SDA to two HR pins in addition to MIO
10/11.  This will allow us to test one leg of HR multiplexing feature
in loopback with the PS.  I suggest using B35_L20_N/P which are
nearby, and moving those LEDs to e.g. B35_L12_N/P.
