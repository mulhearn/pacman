This approach is based on:

One pitfall of this approach is due to a known bug in Vivado (See
Answer Record 75829).  The exported board files for designs that
include some AXISTREAM interconnects due not correctly propogate the
non-default automatically generated values.  The work-around is to
remove the original settings from the board design tcl file, so the
correct values are automatically generated.

In our case, the work around was to remove the lines with - below:

set axis_subset_converter_0 [ create_bd_cell -type ip -vlnv xilinx.com:ip:axis_subset_converter:1.1 axis_subset_converter_0 ]
- set_property -dict [list \
- CONFIG.M_HAS_TSTRB {1} \
- CONFIG.S_HAS_TREADY {1} \
- CONFIG.S_TDATA_NUM_BYTES {16} \
- CONFIG.TDATA_REMAP {tdata[127:0]} \
- CONFIG.TKEEP_REMAP {tkeep[15:0]} \
- CONFIG.TLAST_REMAP {tlast[0]} \
- CONFIG.TSTRB_REMAP {tkeep[15:0]} \
- ] $axis_subset_converter_0

With these lines remove, the TCL-based build works perfectly.  And
these lines are absent from subsequent generated TCL files.
