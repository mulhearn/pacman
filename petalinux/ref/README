This is not a petalinux project.  Petalinux projects are scratch
built.  This is for reference only.

This directory contains a copy of the project_spec directory tree as
configured by the project creation script for the ramdisk linux image.

If you are curious about what exactly has changed when you reconfigure
using the tools, you can compare to these reference directories using e.g.:

    diff --brief --recursive --new-file ref/ramdisk/project-spec/ ramdisk/project-spec

To see what has changed between ramdisk and vanilla, excluding pacman-server and old configs:

   cd ref
   diff --brief --recursive --new-file vanilla/project-spec/ ramdisk/project-spec  | grep -v pacman | grep -v config.old

If you want to use "git diff" instead delete the reference
project-spec and copy in your version for comparison.  But be careful
not to update the references unintentionally.
