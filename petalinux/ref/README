This is not a petalinux project.  Petalinux projects are scratch
built.  This is for reference only.

This directory contains a copy of the project_spec directory tree as
configured by the project creation script for the ramdisk linux image.

If you are curious about what exactly has changed when you reconfigure
using the tools, simply replace the reference project_spec tree with
your new one and use git diff.
